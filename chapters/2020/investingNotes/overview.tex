Modern approaches use Machine Learning
to model fluid market behaviours and complexity.

\begin{itemize}
\item Financial markets are a dynamic, evolving collection of behaviours
\item Use historical data to train a model and adjusts
features and loadings to improve predictive power
\item Integrate the model into an order-execution strategy
\item Retrain and retest continually with new data
to capture the market's current state.
\end{itemize}


Market moves with many human factors that are difficult to measure.
