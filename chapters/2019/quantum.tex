\begin{itemize}
\item It is very rare that a program will run entirely on a QPU. Usually, a program running on a CPU will issue QPU instructions, and later retrieve the results.
\item Some tasks are very well suited to the QPU, and others are not.
\item The QPU runs on a separate clock from the CPU, and usually has its own dedicated hardware interfaces to external devices (such as optical outputs).
\item A typical QPU has its own special RAM, which the CPU cannot efficiently access.
\item Here's a list of pertinent facts about what itâ€™s like to program a QPU:
