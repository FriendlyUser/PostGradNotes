\textbf{The Problems with Immutability} 
Unfortunately, immutability is counter to how computers actually work. A machine has a
limited amount of memory.


The fallacies are these:

\begin{itemize}
\item The network is reliable.
\item Latency is zero.
\item Bandwidth is infinite.
\item The network is secure.
\item Topology doesnâ€™t change.
\item There is one administrator.
\item Transport cost is zero.
\item The network is homogeneous.
\end{itemize}

Didn't feel like reading the rest.
