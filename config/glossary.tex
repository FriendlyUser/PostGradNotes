\newglossaryentry{IoC}
{
	name={IoC},
	description={
		In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) is a programming principle. IoC inverts the flow control as compared to traditional control flow. In IoC, custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from a generic framework. A software architecture with this design inverts control as compared to traditional procedural programming: in traditional programming, the custom code that expresses the purpose of the program calls into reusable libraries to take care of generic tasks, but with inversion of control, it is the framework that calls into the custom, or task-specific, code.
