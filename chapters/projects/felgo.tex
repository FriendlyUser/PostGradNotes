\paragraph{Thoughts}

Setting on felgo cloud builds was a pain, but somehow I managed to do it.

Need to tag that particular release, the problem was a mix of license code, the way numbering works for felgo among other things.

The issue was plugins I did not need, but were added in.

Looking into admob for google suggests I need around 2k view/downloads to make money,

Will shove it in hopefully for something to happen.

\textbf{Magneta Music Generation} Some of the beats generated were acceptable, could make sound effects from randomized shorter effects.

Probably just trial and error as for images, swipe them off the internet, because I still need animations for now.
