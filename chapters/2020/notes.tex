In Flutter, a full compile
generally takes less than 30 seconds, and incremental compiles take less than a second
thanks to hot reloading. 

At a high level, Flutter is a reactive, declarative, and composable view-layer library,
much like ReactJS on the web (but more like React mixed with the browser, because
Flutter is a complete rendering engine as well)
