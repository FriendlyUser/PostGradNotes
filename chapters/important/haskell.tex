Haskell belongs to the family of functional languages.
• It embodies in its core the concept of purity, separating the code with
side eﬀects from the rest of the application.
The evaluation model is based on laziness.
• Types are statically checked by the compiler. Also, Haskell features a
type system that is much stronger and expressive than usual.
• Its approach to polymorphism is based on parametricity (similar to
generics in Java and C#) and type classes
